            <div className={styles.intro}>
                <p>Hi, I'm Russel. I'm a {currentAge}-year-old software developer from Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. </p>
                <p className={styles.pronouns}>he/him</p>
            </div>

            <div className={styles.devBackground}>
                <div className={styles.school}>
                    <p>
                        I graduated from the Northern Alberta Institute of Technology (NAIT)'s Digital Media and IT - Computer Software Development program in September 2022.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        During my time there, I learned a multitude of languages, skills, and a foundation of knowledge surrounding the software development life cycle
                        â€” from programming languages such as C#, SQL, and JavaScript to project management, communications, and agile/scrum methodologies.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div className={styles.postSchool}>
                    <p>
                        After school, I decided to work part-time while in pursuit of a software career. I took on some <Link href='/projects'>projects</Link> that I would work
                        on during my off-days, which gave me more software experience and a sense of direction career-wise.
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div className={styles.interests}>
                <p>Outside of software development, I enjoy music, going to the gym, and video games.</p>
                <div className={styles.music}>
                    <p>
                        Music has always been an important part of my life. It can serve as a form of expression, a mood enhancer, and can bring people together. I also believe
                        that music and sound, or a lack thereof, can help portray expression in other forms of media. Movies like Baby Driver and Guardians of the Galaxy
                        wouldn't be what they are without the accompanying music.
                    </p>
                    <p>I took up the guitar at the age of 10, played trumpet throughout junior high and high school, and have touched a drum kit once or twice in my lifetime.
                        Today, the only instrument I continue to play is the guitar (albeit terribly).</p>
                    <p>
                        Music has also taken a more physical form in my life, as I have recently started a vinyl record collection.
                        I currently have 14 records, 6 of which are <button className={styles.recordWallButton} onClick={() => setModalVisible(true)}>hung up on one of my
                            bedroom wall </button>,
                        while the others wait because I can't afford to buy more shelving at the moment. Eventually, I wish to plaster my entire wall full of records.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div className={styles.gym}>
                    <p>
                        Around August 2021, I started going to the gym. Initially, it was a half-baked attempt to change how I looked while going out with my friends.
                        Now, it has become a routine that has improved my physical and mental health.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The COVID-19 pandemic and other life events during that time brought my life to a standstill. My days felt both mundane and hectic at the same time.
                        I dropped school for a semester, wasn't working, and was taking care of my parents due to injuries, meanwhile trying to adjust to the restrictions
                        placed due to the pandemic. Once I started going to the gym, I felt like my days had purpose again. I started working on myself most days of the week
                        and had goals I would work towards.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div className={styles.games}>
                    <p>
                        Video games have always been prevalent in my life. Growing up, my cousins and I would play my grandfather's games almost daily. I vividly recall
                        playing GoldenEye 007 on the N64 after eating dinner every night. Eventually, I would get a computer at home, and I could play games whenever I wanted
                        to.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To this day I enjoy playing games when I have time. Recently, I have been playing Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom,
                        Genshin Impact, Honkai: Star Rail, and first-person shooters like Apex Legends and Valorant now and then. <span>My mental health will not let me
                            play those last two for extended periods of time.</span>
                    </p>
