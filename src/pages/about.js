            <div className={styles.intro}>
                <p>Hi, I'm Russel. I'm a {currentAge}-year-old software developer from Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. </p>
                <p className={styles.pronouns}>he/him</p>
            </div>

            <div className={styles.devBackground}>
                <p>
                    I graduated from the Northern Alberta Institute of Technology (NAIT)'s Digital Media and IT - Computer Software Development program in September 2022.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During my time there, I learned a multitude of languages, skills, and a foundation of knowledge surrounding the software development life cycle
                    â€” from programming languages such as C#, SQL, and JavaScript to project management, communications, and agile/scrum methodologies.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div className={styles.interests}>
                <p>Outside of software development, I enjoy music, going to the gym, and video games.</p>
                <div className={styles.music}>
                    <p>
                        Music has always been an important part of my life. I took up the guitar at the age of 10, and continue to play to this day (albeit terribly).
                        The storytelling and lyricism in hip-hop specifically always captivated me.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Music has also taken a more physical form in my life, as I have recently started a vinyl record collection.
                        I currently have 14 records, 6 of which are hung up on one of my bedroom walls, while the others wait because I can't afford to buy more shelving
                        at the moment.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I believe that music and sound, or a lack thereof, can help portray expression in media.
                        Movies like Baby Driver and Guardians of the Galaxy wouldn't be what they are without the music.
                    </p>

                <div className={styles.gym}>
                    <p>
                        Around August 2021, I started going to the gym. Initially, it was just another thing to do with my friends while attempting to improve my appearance.
                        Now, it has become a routine that has improved my physical and mental health.
                    </p>

                <div className={styles.games}>
                    <p>
                        Video games have always been prevalent in my life. Growing up, my cousins and I would play my grandfather's games almost daily. I vividly recall
                        playing GoldenEye 007 on the N64 after eating dinner. Eventually, I would get a computer at home, and I could play games whenever I wanted to,
                        leading to the destruction of my eyesight.
