                <p>Hi, I'm Russel. I'm a {currentAge}-year-old software developer from Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. </p>
                <p>
                    I graduated from the Northern Alberta Institute of Technology (NAIT)'s Digital Media and IT - Computer Software Development program in September 2022.
                    During my time there, I learned a multitude of languages, skills, and a foundation of knowledge surrounding the software development life cycle
                    â€” from programming languages such as C#, SQL, and JavaScript to project management, communications, and agile/scrum methodologies.
                </p>
